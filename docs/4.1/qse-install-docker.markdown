<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert"><b>IMPORTANT:</b> If you have 'Docker Toolbox' already installed remove older version of Streams4Docker images and containers, and if there already exists a VirtualBox VM names 'streams4100', delete that as well. </div>

## Windows

1.  Install Dockertoolbox
    * See Docker Toolbox page for instructions:  https://www.docker.com/toolbox
1.  Install using all defaults for a 'Full Installation'

1.  Extract the Streams4Docker.zip archive to preferred location
1.  Open Windows PowerShell
    * Application Menu-> All Programs -> Accessories -> Windows Powershell -> Windows PowerShell
    * `cd <Directory where Streams4Docker downloaded>/Docker`
    * `powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -File Streams-build.ps1`
    
    
    Note: default build is 4096 MB memORY; 4 cpus; 50000 Bytes disk. 
    
    To change defaults, for example to 8192 MB mem; 2 cups; 60000 Bytes of disk run 
           "powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -File Streams-build.ps1 8192 2 60000"

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">

## Accessing the IBM Streams Docker container

The Streams Docker container is set up with the following user id and password:

* User ID:  streamsadmin
* Password:  passw0rd
* Root:  passw0rd

After the containers finish the stratup process, you should be able to access the container via:

* Remote Desktop Support from OSx:
    1. Open Finder Window
    1. Select Go -> Connect to Server...
    1. In the Server Address field, enter:  **vnc://127.0.0.1:5901**
    1. Click "+"
    1. Click "Connect"
* VNC Client:
    1. If not already installed, installed a VNC client.
    1. Start the VNC client
    1. Connect to **127.0.0.1:5901**

## Streams Console

You may use the Streams Console outside of the docker container.  To open Streams Console:

1.  Open a browser on your machine (Firefox or Chrome)
1.  Open this URL:  https://127.0.0.1:8443/streams/domain/console
 
## Streams Studio

Streams Studio may be accessed via a VNC session.  To use Streams Studio:

1.  Connect to the Streams Docker desktop using Remote Desktop or VNC.
1.  On the desktop, double click on the Streams Studio icon.

## Remote Streams Studio

Remote Streams Studio, connecting to docker is supported on Windows.  It is not supported on OSx.

When connecting Streams Studio to the docker container:

* Connect to localhost or 127.0.0.1
* Make sure you use 4022 as the SSH port
* When making a connection, check the "Establish SSH Tunnel' check box
* Keep everything else as defaults.

# Useful Docker Commands

  docker images    (list local images)
  docker ps        (list running containers)
  docker ps -a     (list all containers)
  docker rm <container name/ID>  (delete a container)
  docker rmi <image name/ID>     (delte an image)
  docker restart <container name/ID>  (restart an existing stopped container - same ports and volumes will be used as when the container was created.)
~~~~~~

# Useful Docker Machine Commands

~~~~~~
  docker-machine ls    (list machines and state)
  docker-machine start <VM>  (start a VM
  docker-machine stop <VM>   (stop VM)
  docker-machine rm <VM>     (delete the VM, use '--force' at end of command to force delete)
